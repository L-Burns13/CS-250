# CS-250
Portfolio artifacts and reflections from CS 250: Software Development Lifecycle.

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program?
I interpret what users need by breaking their requests down into specific features and requirements. Writing user stories helps clarify what the user wants and shows how the program should work.

How do user stories help with this?
User stories break down what users want into simple, clear steps for development. They keep the project centered on the users and make sure every feature is worth adding.

How do I approach developing programs?
I start by understanding the problem, planning out the structure, and then coding in iterations. I use feedback to improve the program as I go.

What Agile processes do I hope to use in the future?
I plan to use sprints, standups, retrospectives, and continuous feedback to stay focused and adapt quickly.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member means communicating clearly, being reliable, offering help, and staying open to feedback. It also means respecting othersâ€™ ideas and working together toward shared goals.
